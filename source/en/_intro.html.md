# Hello, world!

**ADNJP** (formerly **TokyoADN**) is a small community of users on App.net residing in Japan. You may follow us on App.net at [@adnjp][adnjp], on Twitter at [@adnjapan][adnjapan], and via the hashtag [#adnjp][hadnjp] (or formerly [#tokyoadn][tokyoadn]).

Many of us are Web or software developers, but everyone has their passions and abilities they love to share with others.

[The first gathering][first] was organised in October 2012 by [@kimiecat][kimiecat] (now only active on Twitter) and [@remino][remino] (a.k.a. [@edojin][edojin]). We meet irregularly on the spur of the moment. Events are still occasionaly planned by @remino, but everyone is free to organise something with users of ADN in Japan, and tag their posts.

This site as well as the accounts on App.net and Twitter are managed by @remino. [The code for this site is on GitHub][github], for which you're free to submit pull requests for additions and corrections.
